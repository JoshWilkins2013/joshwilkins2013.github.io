              I grew up in the small town of Avon, NY, and graduated from high school in the spring of 2013,
              ranking 4th in my class. From there I attended school at Monroe Community College (MCC), earning an
              associate degree in Engineering Science. I transferred to the Rochester Institute of Technology
              (RIT), where I completed a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I completed the five-year
              program in just 3.5 years, graduating in the top 1% of my class.<br><br>

              While pursuing my education, I gained valuable experience at Carestream Health, beginning as an
              electrical test technician and later advancing to lead software automation tester. After graduating
              from RIT, I moved from Rochester to Beverly, MA, to join the Frequency and Timing Division at
              Microsemi (now Microchip). During my time there, I gained critical experience in the Position,
              Navigation, and Timing (PNT) domain, along with exposure to RF concepts, applied statistical
              analysis, and hardware automation.<br><br>

              Despite my contributions at Microsemi, career growth opportunities were limited, largely due to
              the company's acquisition. When the Director of Engineering left to join Raytheon, he offered me
              a position with a significant pay increase (over 30%). Transitioning to Raytheon was an easy
              decision. However, my tenure there began just as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, leading to a
              fully remote work arrangement from day one. This flexibility allowed me to relocate back to
              Rochester, where I was able to purchase a home.<br><br>

              About a year after moving back to Rochester, I was given the ultimatum to either return to MA or
              to resign. I chose to seek new opportunities, which led me to Orolia Defense (now Safran
              Federal Systems). At Safran, I gained extensive knowledge about GNSS technology. However,
              challenges such as frequent managerial changes and the lack of technical leadership prompted me
              to leave after about a year.<br><br>

              I am deeply passionate about learning and am eager to transition into a data-driven field.
              Throughout my career, I have focused on projects that harness the power of data in innovative ways.
              Some highlights include developing training models to calibrate hardware, creating tools to
              standardize and synchronize disparate databases, and building real-time interfaces to
              interact with and analyze the frequency data from multiple atomic clocks simultaneously.

              I encourage you to reach out to me <a href="./contact">here</a>. Whether you'd like to introduce
              yourself, propose project ideas, or discuss job opportunities, I’d love to connect! I’m also
              excited about the prospect of collaborating on new and innovative projects with people!<br><br>
