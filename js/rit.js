      To my amazement, none existed. I then looked for an engineering club... again nothing. I doubled up on classes and\
      started working at Carestream while attending RIT and finished the degree in half the time it would've taken normally.\
      I graduated in December (2016) with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.<br><br>\
      This is not to say that RIT was a poor school. I still believe its on par with many of the more well known schools\
      throughout the country. What I am saying, is that education in general is in some serious need of reform. Anyone\
      who believes having a degree makes you an engineer is outright wrong. Experience is what truly makes someone better\
