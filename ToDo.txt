General:
- Move descriptions into json files?
- Sidebar collapses before next page loads sometimes
- Add sort order to block images?
- Use Block for education and experience somehow - this should fix layout issues
- Fix Footer to span entire bottom?
    - Footer animation broken, add contact button, site map, etc.
- Fix block heights in projects so that image loading doesn't jump (min block height to the largest image?)

    - Add more travel images, auto sort by date?
- Go through pictures, add any 'projects' I think I should add
