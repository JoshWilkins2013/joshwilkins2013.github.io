                    <p>
                      A few years after my time at Microchip, I was presented with an interesting opportunity.
                      The Director of Engineering, who had recently decided to leave the company, personally reached
                      out to me about joining him at Raytheon. The offer included a salary increase of over 30%,
                      and the work would be more RF-focused, which piqued my interest at the time. Having not
                      received a raise since starting at Microchip, the offer was an easy decision.<br><br>

                      This specific branch of Raytheon was in Marlborough, MA, which was about an hour away from
                      my home at the time. To make the commute easier, I decided to relocate to Framingham, MA.
                      Coincidentally, this was around the time COVID-19 had begun to emerge, and after receiving
                      my laptop on my first day, I ended up working remotely almost exclusively,
                      never needing to go into the office.<br>
