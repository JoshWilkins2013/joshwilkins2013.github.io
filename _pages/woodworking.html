                  After building a bed frame, I decided to make night stands to match the frame. This was my
                  first time making something with dovetails and I think they came out alright. I also made a
                  leg tapering jig which I am sure I will find use for in later projects.

                {% capture project_description %}
                  I want to say these are similar to my night stands, but the construction of these two
                  projects are vastly different. I made these to complement the mission-style design of the
                  sofa table my father made for me. They accompany the couch and provide some place for food or
                  drink while watching TV.

                {% capture project_description %}
                  These bar stools were designed for the new bar top in my kitchen renovation. The inward leg
                  support was a mistake as it's practically unusable as a foot rest. However, after adding a
                  cushion to the top of these, they suffice.

                  Alright, I’ll admit it — this wasn't made by me. My father built 4 of these total, giving
                  one to each of my brothers and I, as well as keeping one for himself.

                  My first larger woodworking project was this bed frame. While sleigh-style and mission-style
                  frames are quite nice, I wanted something more minimalistic in design and simpler to build.

                  It took a couple of iterations to get the tissue lid design correct without the tissue ripping,
                  but it works like a charm now. The lid was also designed with embedded magnets to keep it in
                  place and allow for quick tissue box replacement.
