                  A convenient price comparison tool for popular websites like Craigslist and eBay, designed to
                  help analyze car prices or apartment rentals and identify the best deals. This tool could
                  potentially be enhanced and abstracted to include additional housing sites such as Zillow
                  and Trulia. Comparison results are displayed in a scatter plot, with each data point linked
                  to the original listing.

                    An alternative benefit of my price abstractor tool is having access to real-world car and rental
                    data! From this data, I have analyzed which car model was best within each make and which model
                    was best overall. The results are intuitive; the more you spend on a car, the faster it will
                    depreciate! Perhaps if the prices were normalized by their initial price, a more even
                    distribution of depreciation rates would be seen, indicating all cars depreciate at the same
                    weighted rate.<br>

                  I was curious to see the benefits of owning a home over renting. At what point would you
                  recouperate the down-payment? How much money do you save over renting, long-term? How much do
                  banks really make on the interest of your mortgage? So I created a tool with adjustable sliders
                  to compare and assess different financial situations.<br>
